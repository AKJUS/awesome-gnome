# Awesome GNOME (proposal)

> A (proposal for a) curated list of awesome applications, extensions and developpement tools for the GNOME Desktop Environneemnt and the GNOME Shell

**Notice** : This list is an old project of might that I have cleaned up and published for TheOriginalFannibal's [posts on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/6h72os/any_listing_of_gnome_apps_that_follow_hig_and/). That's means that this list might be replaced by his own list (I don't aim to compete with anybody), deplaced from my repository to a Github organisation in order to make it simpler to access to everybody, relicenced, etc. If something like that happen, this whole README will be replaced with a link to the project to follow :) 

That also mean that this list is highly incomplete for the moment.

---

**[TODO] :** 

- Create good guidelines on what can be on this list (especially about applications on the git.gnome.org git : should this list just advertise non-core applications as advertising Nautilus for instance would be quite usefull ?)

- How much should those application follow the GNOME HIG ? Is having the global look sufficient (for instance is having non-symbolic icons in the headerbar problematic or not ?)

- Better classification for themes
